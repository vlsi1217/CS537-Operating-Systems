For the shell, I use the concept prof Remzi discussed in class. For non-built-in command, I create child process and use exec to execute it. For built in commnad, I just call the appropriate system call provided by Unix. 

For the scheduler, I change the scheduler function & the yield fucntion in proc.c . I added two syscall setticket and getpinfo. I added pstat struct and changed proc struct.

I also changed how trap work to add ticks and give more time slice for low priority jobs.
